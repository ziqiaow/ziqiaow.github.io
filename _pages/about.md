My name is Ziqiao Wang—I am interested in understanding how genetics, genomics, and environmental factors together drive the development of human diseases. I specialize in statistical methodology developments, data analysis, and theoretical investigations, and my research typically utilizes large-scale datasets from biobanks and epidemiological studies that include molecular genetic and genomic data, along with human behavioral and lifestyle factors.

One area of my research is polygenic scores (PGS), measures meant to summarize a person’s genetic predisposition for a trait and/or a disease such as cancers and childhood developmental disorders. While PGS are becoming more and more predictive of disease risks, there is much work to be done in the interpretations and applications of PGS. In particular, one part of my work is to develop novel statistical methods to jointly model gene-environment correlations and interactions using PGS in case-control studies, with data applications in the UK Biobank (Wang et al., AJE, 2023). Another aspect of my work is to estimate risk parameters of PGS using family-based studies to understand genetic direct, indirect, and gene-environment interactions between genotype-phenotype associations.

Another aspect of my work is in integrative omics using individual-level and summary statistics to understand the disease mechanisms. I developed novel methods that improve the statistical power of large-scale association studies by incorporating the between-data correlations using summary statistics in multiple omic and spatially-resolved omic datasets (Wang et al., Bioinformatics, 2020; Wang et al., 2023). I also investigated DNA methylation biomarkers associated with pancreatic cancer through epigenome-wide association studies (Wang et al., Epigenetics, 2022). I also extensively involved in various collaboration work with biologists, epidemiologists, and physicians studying different cancers and cardiovascular diseases using various types of genetic and genomic data.

For my future career, I intend to continue my research in the interdisciplinary field of genetics, genomics, and human diseases, to serve the goal of a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms, in the long term improving human health.
